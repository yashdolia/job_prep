"""NotebookLM API Client - Main entry point.

This module provides the NotebookLMClient class, a modern async client
for interacting with Google NotebookLM using undocumented RPC APIs.

Example:
    async with NotebookLMClient.from_storage() as client:
        # List notebooks
        notebooks = await client.notebooks.list()

        # Add sources
        source = await client.sources.add_url(notebook_id, "https://example.com")

        # Generate artifacts
        status = await client.artifacts.generate_audio(notebook_id)
        await client.artifacts.wait_for_completion(notebook_id, status.task_id)

        # Chat with the notebook
        result = await client.chat.ask(notebook_id, "What is this about?")

    Provides access to NotebookLM functionality through namespaced sub-clients:

    - research: Start research sessions and import sources

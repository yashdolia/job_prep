# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Periodic keepalive task on `NotebookLMClient`** - Long-lived clients (agents, workers, multi-hour `async with` blocks) can now opt into a background task that periodically pokes `https://accounts.google.com/CheckCookie` to drive `__Secure-1PSIDTS` rotation, then persists the rotated cookie to `storage_state.json` immediately so a crash doesn't lose the freshness. Disabled by default — pass `keepalive=<seconds>` to `NotebookLMClient(...)` or `NotebookLMClient.from_storage(...)` to enable. Values below `keepalive_min_interval` (default 60 s) are clamped up to that floor. The loop swallows transient errors at DEBUG and continues; cancellation on `__aexit__` is clean. Closes the gap left by the per-call layer-1 poke for clients that never re-call `fetch_tokens` (#297, #312).
- **Auto-refresh on auth expiry** - `fetch_tokens` now optionally runs a user-provided shell command when a Google session cookie has expired, reloads cookies from the same storage path, and retries once. Opt in by setting the `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD` environment variable to a command that rewrites `storage_state.json` (e.g. a sync script reading from a cookie vault). Refresh commands receive `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_STORAGE_PATH` and `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_PROFILE` so profile-aware scripts can target the active auth file. Covers every CLI entry point without changing the public API. Retry guards prevent refresh loops.
- **Proactive SIDTS rotation poke** - Every `fetch_tokens` call now makes a best-effort GET to `https://accounts.google.com/CheckCookie` before hitting `notebooklm.google.com`. Google emits a rotated `__Secure-1PSIDTS` (the freshness partner of `__Secure-1PSID`) when the client touches the identity surface; RPC traffic against `notebooklm.google.com` alone does not appear to trigger rotation, so a keepalive that hits NotebookLM alone can silently stale out after ~10-30 minutes. The rotated `Set-Cookie` lands in the live httpx jar and is persisted by `ClientCore.close` (built on the on-close save introduced in #276). Failures are logged at DEBUG and never abort token fetch. Disable with `NOTEBOOKLM_DISABLE_KEEPALIVE_POKE=1` (e.g. networks that block `accounts.google.com`). Closes #312.
- **`examples/refresh_browser_cookies.py`** - Sample `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD` script that re-extracts cookies from a live local browser via `notebooklm login --browser-cookies`, providing a turnkey recovery path for unattended automation when the in-process keepalive isn't enough (idle gaps, force-logout, password change).
- **`notebooklm auth refresh` CLI command** - One-shot keepalive that opens a session, triggers the layer-1 SIDTS rotation poke against `accounts.google.com`, persists the rotated cookies to `storage_state.json`, and exits. Designed to be scheduled by the OS (launchd / systemd / cron / Task Scheduler / k8s CronJob) to keep an idle profile from staling out between user-driven calls. Pairs naturally with `--quiet` for log-only-on-error cron output. See `docs/troubleshooting.md` for per-OS scheduler recipes.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added
- **Multi-account profiles** - Switch between Google accounts without re-authenticating (#227)
  - `notebooklm profile create/list/switch/rename/delete` commands
  - Global `--profile` / `-p` flag and `NOTEBOOKLM_PROFILE` environment variable to scope any command to a profile
  - Per-profile storage paths under `~/.notebooklm/profiles/<name>/`
  - Implicit default profile preserved for backward compatibility; existing `~/.notebooklm/storage_state.json` is auto-detected as the default profile (no manual migration needed)
- **`notebooklm doctor` diagnostic command** - `notebooklm doctor [--fix] [--json]` checks profile setup, auth, and migration status; reports actionable issues
- **Microsoft Edge SSO login** - `notebooklm login --browser msedge` for organizations that require Edge for SSO (#204)
- **Browser cookie import** - Reuse cookies from your existing browser session without driving Playwright
  - `notebooklm login --browser-cookies <browser>` (chrome, edge, firefox, safari, etc.)
  - New `convert_rookiepy_cookies_to_storage_state()` Python helper
  - Optional `[cookies]` extra installs `rookiepy` (`pip install "notebooklm-py[cookies]"`)
  - Honors the active profile: `notebooklm --profile <name> login --browser-cookies <browser>` writes to that profile's `storage_state.json`. Note that cookie extraction always pulls the source browser's currently-active Google account for `google.com` / `notebooklm.google.com` — to populate multiple profiles from the same browser, switch the active Google account in the browser between runs (or use a separate browser per profile).
- **EPUB source type** - Upload `.epub` files as notebook sources (#231)
- **Agent skill installation** - Install the bundled NotebookLM skill into local AI agents (#206, #207)
  - `notebooklm skill install` - Install into `~/.claude/skills/notebooklm` and `~/.agents/skills/notebooklm`
  - `notebooklm skill status` - Check installation state
  - `notebooklm agent show codex` / `notebooklm agent show claude` - Print bundled agent templates

- **`note list --json`** - Machine-readable note listings (#259)
- **Bare status codes in decoder errors** - Decoder surfaces server status codes on null RPC results for clearer diagnostics (#114, #294)

### Fixed
- **Cross-domain cookie preservation** - Login storage state retains cookies across `google.com` and `notebooklm.google.com` subdomains, restoring sessions for regional domains
- **NotebookLM subdomain cookies** - Subdomain cookies are no longer dropped during login (#334)
- **Video artifact detection** - Correctly detect completed video media URLs in polling responses (#333)
- **Research import on unavailable snapshots** - CLI gracefully handles missing source snapshots during research import (#335)

- **Quota detection during polling** - Detect quota / daily-limit failures during artifact polling (#240)
- **Google account switching** - Fixed switching between Google accounts at login time (#246)
- **YouTube URL extraction** - Extract YouTube URLs at deeply-nested response positions (#265)

- **Custom storage path for downloads** - Artifact downloads now respect custom auth storage paths (#235)
- **Windows file permissions** - Skip Unix-only `0o600` calls on Windows and rely on Python 3.13+ ACL behavior (#225)
- **TOCTOU protection** - Hardened directory creation in `session.py` (#225)

### Changed
- **`rookiepy` is an optional `[cookies]` extra** - Excluded from `[all]` to avoid Python 3.13+ install issues; install with `pip install "notebooklm-py[cookies]"`
- **Login error detection** - Improved detection of missing browser binaries (e.g., `msedge` not installed)
- **Skill installation paths** - Hardened to handle alternative `~/.claude` and `~/.agents` layouts
- **Deprecation removal deferred to v0.5.0** - The deprecated APIs originally scheduled for removal in v0.4.0 — `StudioContentType`, `Source.source_type`, `SourceFulltext.source_type`, `Artifact.artifact_type`, `Artifact.variant`, and `DEFAULT_STORAGE_PATH` — continue to work and emit `DeprecationWarning`. Removal is now planned for v0.5.0 to give downstream users an extra release to migrate.

### ⚠️ Beta Release Notice

This is the initial public release of `notebooklm-py`. While core functionality is tested and working, please note:

- **RPC Protocol Fragility**: This library uses undocumented Google APIs. Method IDs can change without notice, potentially breaking functionality. See [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md) for debugging guidance.
- **Unofficial Status**: This is not affiliated with or endorsed by Google.
- **API Stability**: The Python API may change in future releases as we refine the interface.

### Known Issues

- **RPC method IDs may change**: Google can update their internal APIs at any time, breaking this library. Check the [RPC Development Guide](docs/rpc-development.md) for how to identify and update method IDs.
- **Rate limiting**: Heavy usage may trigger Google's rate limits. Add delays between bulk operations.
- **Authentication expiry**: CSRF tokens expire after some time. Re-run `notebooklm login` if you encounter auth errors.
- **Large file uploads**: Files over 50MB may fail or timeout. Split large documents if needed.
